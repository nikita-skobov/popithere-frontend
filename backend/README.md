# BACKEND

Here, I would keep my deployment scripts, serverless configuration
as well as all of my API/WebSocket handler code.

In my [previous project](https://github.com/nikita-skobov/collabopath), CollaboPath, I included all of my deployment scripts, and backend setup. If you are curious about how I deploy my apps please take a look at CollaboPath. The methods I used there are almost identical to the ones I use in this project. If you just want to see the live CollaboPath site: https://collabopath.com
