# Pop It Here!

This is the code for the website popithere.com

I am releasing this publically for two reasons:

- For aspiring developers to see how I write my code, and potentially learn how bigger projects are maintained (Although I would not describe my code to be very good, I feel that it would still be of use to some people)
- For other developers who enjoy the site to be able to make their own additions to it
  - I tried to structure the website in a modular way such that other developers can create their own 'Games' and addons. Feel free to [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/WgppuWr) to discuss features you'd like to add, and I'd be happy to help you get started.
